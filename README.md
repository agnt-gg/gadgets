# AGNT.gg Gadgets

This repository contains a collection of useful tools, utilities, and other cool stuff developed as part of the process of building AGNT.gg.

## About

AGNT.gg is a exciting new project that we're working on. As we build out the platform, we've come across the need for various custom tools and solutions. 
Rather than keeping these to ourselves, we've decided to open source them in this "Toolbox" for anyone to use and contribute to.

## Tools & Utilities

Here's a quick overview of some of the tools and utilities you'll find in this repository:

- **Session Recording System w/ AI Analysis**: A session recording system that records the cursor movements / clicks over a user session and reports it back to a server / DB. Includes a session viewing tool and AI session analysis.
- **Popup Tour System**: A fun and easy to use popup tour system that allows you to show tour-like popup notifications to your users.
- **LLM Stream to Markdown / HTML**: A handy module for getting streams from LLMs and displaying outputs as Markdown / HTML content in real-time.
- **Pseudo-Random Name Generator**: Create unique, random-sounding names for characters, projects, etc.

More tools are being added all the time, so be sure to check back frequently!

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from the community! If you've developed a cool tool that you think would be a good fit for AGNT, please feel free to submit a pull request. Be sure to include:

- A brief description of the tool
- Installation/usage instructions
- Any relevant screenshots or demos

Let's build something awesome together!
