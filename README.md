Rather than keeping these to ourselves, we've decided to open source them in this "Toolbox" for anyone to use and contribute to.

- **LLM Stream to Markdown / HTML**: A handy module for getting streams from LLMs and displaying outputs as Markdown / HTML content in real-time.
- **Pseudo-Random Name Generator**: Create unique, random-sounding names for characters, projects, etc.

More tools are being added all the time, so be sure to check back frequently!
